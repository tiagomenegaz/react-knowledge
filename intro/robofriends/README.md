# Robofriends App

This is a small web app to simulate a robot social network

### Getting Started

I've created this project using the library `create-react-app`. You can install it using

```
# you might need sudo to run this command
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```
# Starts the development server.
yarn start
# Bundles the app into static files for production.
yarn build
# Starts the test runner.
yarn test
# Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
yarn eject
```
