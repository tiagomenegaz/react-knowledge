# Introduction

Here I describe a few key concepts to understand what react does more clearly.

### Components

Atoms > Molecules > Organisms > Template > Page

The main focus of components is create reuseable codes that can be used on different parts of the webpage. The behaviour of each "copy" of a component is replicated in every instance.

### One Way Data Flow

Data flows top to bottom. In a component structure there are parent and children components. Every time a component changes only its children are changed.

### Virtual DOM

React creates an abstraction to interact to the actual browser's DOM.
